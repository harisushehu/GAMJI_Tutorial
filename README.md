# Python for Data Analysis and Visualization Tutorial

## Aim of the Tutorial
Welcome to the Python Data Analysis and Visualization Tutorial that was conducted yesterday for GAMJI mentors. This tutorial focused on providing hands-on experience with data analysis and visualization using Python. We explored data analysis techniques and created various visualizations to gain insights from the data.

## Files in this Repository

1. **2019elections.csv**: This CSV file contains the dataset used for the tutorial. It serves as the foundation for the data analysis and visualization examples.

2. **Data analysis repositories.pdf**: This PDF file contains links to other data analysis repositories, offering additional resources for further learning.

3. **GAMJI_PythonTutorial.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file is the core of the tutorial. It's where all the data analysis and visualization demonstrations are carried out. The notebook is designed to be interactive and engaging.

4. **nigeria_regions.json**: This JSON file contains the shape data needed for the choropleth map visualization showcasing the distribution of votes obtained by APC and PDP political parties across different regions in Nigeria.

## How to Run the Code

### Option 1: Google Colaboratory

You can easily run the tutorial notebook on Google Colaboratory, a cloud-based platform that supports Jupyter notebooks. Simply follow this link to access and run the notebook: [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/your-repo/blob/main/GAMJI_PythonTutorial.ipynb).

### Option 2: Local Environment

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
3. Place the following three files in the same directory:
   - GAMJI_PythonTutorial.ipynb
   - 2019elections.csv
   - nigeria_regions.json
4. Open GAMJI_PythonTutorial.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
5. Modify the dataset and shape file directory paths as needed within the notebook.
